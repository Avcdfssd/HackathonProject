        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            At RareConnect, we aim to bridge the gap in healthcare for patients suffering from rare diseases in Nepal. 
            Our mission is to create an ecosystem that connects patients, doctors, researchers, and non-profits to tackle rare diseases collaboratively and effectively.
        </p>
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
            RareConnect is a platform designed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread awareness about rare diseases and their symptoms.</li>
            <li>Empower patients to report symptoms and receive AI-driven diagnoses.</li>
            <li>Enable doctors to diagnose and escalate unique cases to researchers.</li>
            <li>Provide a streamlined way for patients to request financial support from non-profits.</li>
            <li>Promote collaboration between healthcare professionals and researchers for proactive solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why RareConnect?</h3>
        <p>
            In a country like Nepal, where healthcare infrastructure is fragmented, RareConnect offers:
            <strong>faster diagnosis, financial accessibility, and proactive research opportunities.</strong>
            We believe no disease is too rare to diagnose, no treatment is too expensive to fund, and no life is too insignificant to save.
